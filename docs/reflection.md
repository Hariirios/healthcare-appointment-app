# Reflection on Challenges and Tools Used

During the development of the requirements engineering documentation for the Mobile App for Healthcare Appointments, several challenges were encountered:

## üß† Challenges Faced

1. **Structuring Requirements Clearly**  
   Deciding how to separate and prioritize functional vs non-functional requirements required careful thought. It was important to keep them distinct but connected.

2. **Identifying Accurate Stakeholders and Roles**  
   Determining which roles should appear in the use case diagram and which should stay in the stakeholder table was not obvious at first. Clarifying actor responsibilities took time.

3. **Maintaining Consistency Across Documents**  
   Ensuring that requirement IDs, use case descriptions, and traceability matrix entries matched correctly required regular checking.

4. **Use Case Diagram Design**  
   Using Draw.io to position actors and arrows neatly was slightly time-consuming, especially when avoiding clutter or duplication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Used: GitHub

GitHub was used to:
- Store all project files and documentation
- Organize files into meaningful folders (docs, diagrams, specs)
- Track requirement items with readable markdown
- Provide version control and easy updates

Using GitHub helped keep everything organized, visible, and trackable. It also supports collaboration if needed in the future.
